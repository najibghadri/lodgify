# Lodgify homework

- Tested on Web, iOS and Android
- The main component is in a sub-package named `grouped_tasks`: I made it like this because I think this is a component that would be reused on a page possibly multiple times. It exposes three main components:
  - `GroupedTasksList` which is a model and has `fromJson` method
  - `GroupedTasksNotifier` which is a ValueNotifier and has `updateTasks` and `updateTaskCheck` methods
  - `GroupedTasksWidget` which is the whole UI component which takes a `GroupedTasksNotifier` and a title as arguments
- for state management I started out using `riverpod` (a better `provider`), but found that using `flutter_hooks` and ValueNotifier is enough.
- The tasks are fetched on startup from the gist url and parsed, then they are fed to the notifier.
- Used only 3 additional packages:
  - `flutter_hooks` - a great library that brings hooks to flutter like they are in React, it allows for much cleaner code and reusability.
  - `freezed` - productive model class generator with equality and deep copy helpers. This is actually optional, could have used `equatable` instead. Helps for immutable changes in `ValueNotifier`. (also needs `build_runner` and `freezed_annotation`)
  - `google_fonts` for the custom font
- The expandable rows and the progressbar are custom components using animations
- Used an efficient calculation algorithm and unit tested it

## improvement notes

- Use local fonts and remove `google_fonts` in production
- loading state using `shimmer`
- UI regression tests
- Better themeing
- etc, ...

P.S.

- Had to copy the api gist provided since it contains inconsistent fields. Not sure if this was intentional or it needs to be updated ðŸ˜„.
